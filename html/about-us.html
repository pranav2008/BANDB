    Hi, my name is Pranav, and I am the owner of this restaurant. It was founded in 2018. I have liked fresh, homemade Indian food since I was young. I have always been passionate about sharing the flavors of my culture with others, which is why I opened this restaurant. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Our menu is inspired by traditional family recipes that have been passed down for generations. Our goal is to provide authentic and delicious Indian cuisine in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. 
    We strive to create a dining experience that transports our guests to the streets of India with every bite. We source our ingredients locally and use traditional cooking techniques to ensure that every dish is bursting with flavor. 
    Our team is dedicated to providing exceptional service and creating a memorable dining experience for all of our guests.

    Every day before the store opens, we cook food for the homeless. Our commitment to giving back to the community extends beyond our restaurant walls. 
    By preparing meals for those in need, we aim to make a positive impact and spread joy through our love of cooking. 
    Our passion for food goes beyond just serving delicious meals; it's about making a difference in the lives of others. We believe that good food should be enjoyed by everyone, and we are proud to do our part in helping those less fortunate.

     You can help by volunteering in the mornings to cook. Together, we can make a difference and bring hope to those who need it most. 
     Join us in our mission to serve others and spread kindness through the power of a home-cooked meal. Your time and effort will not only nourish bodies but also warm hearts in our community.
  </p>
